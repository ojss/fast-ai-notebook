       "xxbos xxmaj claire xxmaj booth xxmaj luce 's \" xxmaj the xxmaj women \" shows relationships with men through a woman 's point of view in a play , ( and 1939 film that also has xxmaj joan xxmaj crawford playing a bitch : a character who might have been xxmaj amanda xxmaj farrow 20 years before ) , that has no male characters . xxmaj here we see the male characters and what a bunch they are . xxmaj they use women like toys and throw them away , leaving the women to suffer . xxmaj ironically , the women in \" xxmaj the xxmaj women \" , perhaps because they are all we see , are shown in a less than favorable light , alternately silly and scheming , with the only \" nice \" one , ( xxmaj norma xxmaj shearer ) , growing \" claws \" by the end . xxmaj in \" xxmaj the xxmaj best of xxmaj everything \" we see the men for the cads they are while the women are largely innocent and vulnerable . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj this is a film about women leaping from things . xxmaj diane xxmaj baker leaps from a car , ( in perhaps the most absurd scene in cinema history , which is not in the book ) . xxmaj suzy xxmaj parker falls from a fire escape . xxmaj the women in the film are leaping into the workplace , looking for success and love at the same time . xxmaj women would leap into the future and leave this type of soap opera behind in the next decade . xxmaj but they would come back to it in the 80 's and 90 's through the novels of people like xxmaj sidney xxmaj sheldon and xxmaj judith xxmaj krantz , ( although their trashier works are n't as good as this ) . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the best thing about this film is the way it looks . i love the glossy cinemascope films of the 50 's and 60 's . xxmaj they look so much better than the pixel - challenged home movies we 've been making since , especially in the letterboxed version we see on xxup tv , and the xxup dvd , with the picture so clear you could walk into it . xxmaj the look of the bevy of young beauties in it is also memorable . xxmaj this film probably has more beautiful women in it than any other . xxmaj it has a supermodel , ( xxmaj suzy xxmaj parker ) , a beauty queen , ( xxmaj myrna xxmaj hansen , who was not xxmaj miss xxmaj america 1954 as xxmaj rona xxmaj jaffe says in the xxup dvd commentary but rather xxmaj miss xxup usa 1953 , per the imdb : but so what ) , and a xxmaj playboy playmate , ( xxmaj june xxmaj blair , from xxmaj january 1957 ) . xxmaj my vote goes to xxmaj suzy , one of the astonishing beauties of all time . xxmaj her acting here is n't as awful as people pretend : they are just reacting , as people did then , to the sight of a supermodel , ( the first , really ) , trying to act . xxmaj nobody seemed to care how well she did . xxmaj her role , that of an apparently worldly woman who turns out to be the most vulnerable , is the most complex in the bunch and she does just fine . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj the most touching thing about the film now is the age of the female leads at the time . xxmaj hope xxmaj lange was 27 when they filmed this in the spring of 1959 . xxmaj diane xxmaj baker was 20 . xxmaj suzy xxmaj parker was 26 . xxmaj hope , who looked to be xxmaj grace xxmaj kelly 's heir , never made it really big and wound up being xxmaj mrs. xxmaj muir on television and , per the imdb , wound up living in a home with \" crates for coffee tables \" because she spent her money on causes she believed in before dying at age 72 in 2003 . xxmaj this film must have seemed a very distant and irrelevant memory to her by then . xxmaj baker , always a welcome face in 60 's xxup tv , ( especially to xxmaj richard xxmaj kimble ) , and still active as an actress and acting coach , just turned 67 . xxmaj parker found \" the best of everything \" with xxmaj bradford xxmaj dillman for 40 years before dying at age 70 the same year xxmaj lange did . xxmaj but here they are , young , beautiful and ambitious for success and love , just like their characters .,xxbos 2001 : a xxmaj space xxmaj odyssey \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj is it a sermon ? xxmaj an account of the history of mankind ? xxmaj an exploration of man 's futile attempts to advance technology only to have technology destroy him ? xxmaj is it about the fragile balance of time and space ? a lesson in evolution ? xxmaj or is it just a spectacular effects show ; a film xxmaj kubrick made only to show us the limitless possibilities of the motion picture and present to us the truth that images are exceedingly more powerful than words ? \n",
       " \n",
       "  2001 : a xxmaj space xxmaj odyssey is all of these things . xxmaj one of the most xxunk films ever created , it 's almost more fun to dissect and discuss the ambiguous plot design and events of the film , than it is to actually watch . xxmaj but it 's left open to discussion intentionally ; if xxmaj kubrick had explained the meaning to his wondrous 1968 classic ( ranked # 22 on xxup afi 's list of the greatest 100 films ever made , my personal 21st favorite xxunk , and nominated for 4 xxmaj academy xxmaj awards : xxmaj director , xxmaj original xxmaj screenplay , xxmaj art xxmaj direction , and xxmaj visual xxmaj effects which it won for ) it would have lost half its fascination , all of its complexity , and a good portion of its cinematic worth . xxmaj we would only be left with the technical ingenuity ; which in itself is worth praising . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj because every shot is worth taking the time to look . xxmaj and there is plenty of time . 2001 is very elegiac , and also coolly distant ; detached . xxmaj the emotional remoteness and slow pace pay perfect tribute however to the unique visual experience ; 2001 begins with mankind 's ape ancestors , who upgrade from scavengers of the planet to hunters and xxunk after discovering a giant monolith in the midst of their desert home , then ( in one of motion picture history 's most inspired jump - cut edits ) as a bone is tossed into the air and becomes a satellite , jumping forward a couple thousand years into space , where astronauts have discovered a similar object on the moon , and next the film following a crew of space traveler 's mission as they follow the monolith 's signal through space , accompanied by their untrustworthy computer xxup hal , who attempts to sabotage the shuttle and kill the crew , before finally the lone survivor is launched through space and time ( in a flurry of drug - induced colors that probably gave hippies an epileptic shock back in the day ) to grow old , die , and be reborn a \" xxmaj star - child \" . xxmaj whew . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj this pacing and emotional blankness , is also in sharp contrast with the film 's most ironic scene ; the destruction of xxup hal . xxmaj as the crew 's final explorer shuts the machine down , bathed in the holy aura of red light xxmaj kubrick has always used as a repeat motif , xxup hal singing a lovely tune , it is a strangely emotional experience . xxmaj and it 's all genius . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj other notable aspects of xxmaj kubrick 's masterpiece is the memorable voice of xxup hal ( a calm , somehow sinister , xxmaj douglas xxmaj rain ) , the minimal use of dialogue ( xxmaj kubrick was wisely trusting of his images to propel the film ; giving only banal , unhelpful lines to his actors . xxmaj the most famous being \" xxmaj open the pod bay doors xxup hal \" ) , satellites dancing around in orbit to unorthodox music , and that first , awe - inspiring shot of earth ; slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it , played to the sound of blasting , triumphant horns . \n",
       " \n",
       "  2001 shall always remain a mystery , and will forever be a testament to the cinema 's strongest point : visuals are more powerful than writing . xxmaj it 's all from one of film history 's most legendary and best directors , whose unique vision , was always his own . 10 / 10 \n",
       " \n",
       "  \" xxmaj open the pod bay doors xxup xxunk : a xxmaj space xxmaj odyssey,xxbos xxmaj working in a music store , my xxunk first tipped me this soundtrack . xxmaj the music of this movie is perfect . xxmaj one of my favorite xxup cd 's . xxmaj only years later i saw the movie , i was afraid it would not fulfill my high expectations , luckily it did . a feel good romantic love story .,xxbos i found this movie to be quite enjoyable and fairly entertaining . xxmaj good characters , good actors and enough suspense to keep your interest throughout . xxmaj the plot twists might have been a bit much but overall a decent thriller . xxmaj if you liked this film i would recommend xxmaj the xxmaj spanish xxmaj prisoner , xxmaj the xxmaj house of xxmaj games and xxmaj no xxmaj way xxmaj out .,xxbos xxmaj the basic plot of this film has already been detailed in several other comments so i wo n't bother . i 'd like to first commend the producer , cast , directors and crew for creating a wonderfully engaging film on a meager , $ 1 m budget , a small fraction of standard xxmaj hollywood fare that does n't xxup look cheap . xxmaj these people have a drive to make something new and entertaining while not spending a fortune doing it . xxmaj this is essentially art for art 's sake . i know , i know , some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and that 's fine . i for one am glad that people like these will continue to put forth the time and effort for our benefit without expecting huge multimillion dollar payoffs . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj now to the criticism . i feel that the scenario presented is credible to a point . xxmaj it 's wonderful when everything works out and the hero / heroine saves the day and all 's well that ends well . xxmaj what gets me is the blatant manipulation of events so that blind luck is responsible more than courage and strength . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj when lee was attacked but not severely injured , somehow she washed up on a mud bank right next to the dead guide . xxmaj then , miraculously , his loaded revolver is still in his holster and it actually works ( after some cleaning and fiddling ) . xxmaj finally , when xxmaj lee is attacked on the mud bank and jumps in the water , once again the croc fails to kill her . xxmaj she ends up with her hand in his ( her ? ) mouth and manages to repeatedly pull the trigger , ultimately to blow the croc 's brains out ( literally ) . \n",
       " \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj other notable aspects of xxmaj kubrick 's masterpiece is the memorable voice of xxup hal ( a calm , somehow sinister , xxmaj douglas xxmaj rain ) , the minimal use of dialogue ( xxmaj kubrick was wisely trusting of his images to propel the film ; giving only banal , unhelpful lines to his actors . xxmaj the most famous being \" xxmaj open the pod bay doors xxup hal \" ) , satellites dancing around in orbit to unorthodox music , and that first , awe - inspiring shot of earth ; slowly revealing the glare of the sun in front of it , played to the sound of blasting , triumphant horns . \n",

       "  xxmaj now , of course you should challenge xxmaj moore 's ideas . xxmaj of course you should make up your own mind and try to find the facts yourself . xxmaj that 's the whole point of democracy . xxmaj but where xxmaj moore is brilliant with expressing his points and political viewpoint , xxmaj wilson is far too blunt . xxmaj it even gets to the point where you get the feeling that xxmaj wilson is not even challenging xxmaj moore but is in it for his own personal witch hunt out of some personal dislike . xxmaj which is exactly what he 's accusing xxmaj moore for doing to xxmaj mr xxup c. xxmaj heston and xxup xxunk xxmaj bush . xxmaj and this , of course , is not good since as a fact he then becomes xxmaj moore . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj at a point i could almost see him crying off camera because xxmaj moore does n't return his calls . xxmaj and , come on xxmaj wilson , why did you try to make a point about if he cursed or not ? a big difference between xxmaj moore and xxmaj wilson is also this ; xxmaj where xxmaj moore gets people to speak their mind , xxmaj wilson will get to use the interviews as long as \" they do n't look bad \" . xxmaj do n't look bad ? xxmaj that 's the whole point of investigating journalism , if it looks bad it probably is and you should bring it out in the open . xxmaj not the corporate approved statements and views . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj further more , the sections with xxmaj penn ( yes , xxmaj penn from xxunk ) screams \" xxmaj you should only show what is government approved \" . i ca n't help to recall what the late xxmaj bill xxmaj hicks said : \" xxmaj you are free to do what we tell you ! xxmaj here 's 16 channels of xxmaj american xxmaj gladiators to choose from \" . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj now , it might be that we in xxmaj europe are more used to harsh journalists that dissect everything , but i get a feeling that xxmaj wilson does not fully understand how and why you do an investigating documentary . xxmaj if peoples toes are going to be stepped on ? xxmaj sure . xxmaj if people are going to get mad because things are shown that was n't supposed to be ? xxmaj of course . xxmaj if this is wrong ? xxmaj not a bit . \n",
       " \n",
       "  a cause , belief or movement that ca n't stand to be investigated or made fun of , is not meant to survive . xxmaj it 's as simple as that . \n",
       " \n",
       "  i could go on and on and point out the errors i think xxmaj wilson is doing this film . xxmaj the truth is that xxmaj wilson should have practiced a bit more first before taking on a challenge as this . xxmaj he is accusing xxmaj moore of editing his movies and then he does the same thing himself . xxmaj he makes a point of xxmaj moore using comments and interviews out of context and then , yes you guessed right , he does it himself . xxmaj he twists and turns from challenging xxmaj moores movies to challenging xxmaj moore himself . xxmaj it all turns into a amateurish soup where you have no real thread to follow . i even felt , after the shop door incident , that he was trying to do a \" xxmaj cops \" episode . \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj no , xxmaj wilson , this is not good . xxmaj you should have practiced by making some xxmaj youtube movies first to get warm in the clothes before going for the trophy ; xxmaj michael xxmaj moore .,xxbos xxmaj this is one of my favourite films of all time . xxmaj it has such a feel good factor that i get it out and watch it at least three times a year and have done since i was kid , surfing with my friends in xxmaj cornwall in the early eighties . xxmaj following the lives of three friends from 1962 to the \" great swell \" of 1974 , this is a beautifully shot movie with warm characters that you grow to really care about . xxmaj from the opening credits with , believe it or not , the wonderfully mellow voice - over provided by xxmaj robert xxmaj england , to the final mega surfing scene the story pulls you in with it 's glorious scenery , great acting and superbly shot surfing scenes . xxmaj based around xxmaj milius 's own experiences this is a classic and in my opinion , the best surfing film ever made .\n",
